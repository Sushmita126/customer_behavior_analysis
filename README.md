 Customer Behaviour Data Analysis Project
📋 Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end data analysis process — from data loading and cleaning to visualization and reporting.
It aims to extract insights on customer purchasing behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
The final deliverable includes a Power BI dashboard, a structured analytical report, and a presentation summarizing the key findings.

⚙️ Project Steps
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python (Jupyter Notebook).

Checked basic structure using .head(), .info(), and .describe().

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explored data distributions, outliers, and missing values.

Used visualizations (histograms, countplots, boxplots) for insight generation.

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values using median and mode imputation.

Standardized column names and data types.

Removed duplicate and inconsistent records.

4. SQL Integration

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server using SQLAlchemy.

Executed analytical SQL queries to answer business questions, such as:

Top 5 products by review rating

Average purchase frequency by age group

Category-wise revenue contribution

5. Dashboard Creation

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:

Sales performance by category and region

Customer demographics

Purchase frequency trends

Review rating distributions

6. Reporting & Presentation

Compiled findings into a concise analytical report.

Designed a professional presentation using Gamma highlighting insights, trends, and recommendations.

📈 Dashboard Highlights

Dynamic filters for category, region, and time period

KPIs for total customers, revenue, and average rating

Drill-through analysis of customer segments

🧾 Results & Insights

Identified top-performing product categories.

Observed that frequent buyers had higher satisfaction ratings.

Found that “Adult” and “Middle-aged” segments contributed most to revenue.

Recommended optimizing marketing strategies toward loyal high-frequency buyers.
